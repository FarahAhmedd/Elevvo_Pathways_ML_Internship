# Machine Learning Tasks

This repository contains a collection of machine learning tasks (from regression and clustering to recommendation systems, time-series forecasting, and deep learning).  
Each task is implemented in Python as an independent script.  

## Important Note about Datasets
Datasets are **not included** in this repository due to large file sizes.  
- You must manually download them and place them in a `Datasets/` folder.  
- Or use the Kaggle API to fetch them instead of the _read_csv_ function.
- Update the file paths inside each script to point to your dataset location.

### Using Kaggle APIs
```bash
kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-identifier>
```

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/FarahAhmedd/Elevvo_Pathways_ML_Internship
```
```bash
 cd Elevvo_Pathways_ML_Internship
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download datasets and place them in a Datasets folder or add the Kaggle API.
